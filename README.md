# Pure CSS Images

This is a repository created to keep the work for Michael Mangialardi's [How to Make Pure CSS Images to Progress With Design-Focused Frontend Development](https://coding-artist.teachable.com/p/how-to-make-pure-css-images) course.

I am doing this as a part of @P1xt's prep for ["Suck Less at CSS" November Challenge.](https://medium.com/p1xts-blog/lets-make-november-suck-less-at-css-month-7fa7c80b5387)

Specifically, this it was recommended in the accompanying [mini challenge blog post](https://medium.com/p1xts-blog/mini-challenge-prep-for-suck-less-at-css-november-b04b30799ef6).

I will update this repository with my work for the course as well as the additional projects listed in the mini challenge blog post.
